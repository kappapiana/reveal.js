# Why?

---
## No Software Comes Without Licence Tag

You think that because there is no licensing condition attached to the software, there is no restriction? **Think better!**

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Full copyright is by default</li>
<li class="fragment">Seek license</li>
<li class="fragment">Without a licence (or *license*), you are stuck with statutory provisions </li>
</ul>

---
## Inbound vs Outbound Licensing, derivative software

Nobody writes software from scratch!

<ul>
<li class="fragment">You take some code</li>
<li class="fragment">That code has its own conditions</li>
<li class="fragment">Conditions of software you are reusing is called <strong>inbound</strong> </li>
<li class="fragment">Conditions of software you are *distributing* is called <strong>outbound</strong></li>
<li class="fragment">If software contains substantial fragments of other software, it is a <strong>derivative</strong>.</li>
<li class="fragment">Derivative software needs permission from the original(s)</li>
</ul>
---

## Why is it important to know?

A license can be very simple and just permit whatever to whomever. But with most licenses, **permission** is granted only *provided that* you comply with **conditions**

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>If</strong> condition is complied with, <strong>then</strong> you can {modify, distribute original or modified software}</li>
<li class="fragment"> <strong>If</strong> condition <strong>is not</strong> complied with, <strong>then</strong> you cannot {modify, distribute original or modified software}</li>
</ul>

+++

## Is this "copyleft"?

No, copyleft is a *subclass* of  Free Software conditions.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Conditions impact on <strong>outbound</strong> software, and outbound license</li>
<li class="fragment">One condition is <strong>"inbound license == outbound license"</strong></li>
<li class="fragment">Depending on the scope of this condition (just the library, the file or the entire derivative), we have <strong>"strong"</strong> or <strong>"weak copyleft"</strong>
</li>
---

## A Clash of Licenses

The more conditions and the stricter, the more likely you have **incompatibilities**: there is no state in which you can comply with both.

---

## Compliance

Means *respect* conditions upon which you receive a Free Software *grant*

---

# How?

---

## Different strategies

<ul>
<li class="fragment">SPDX, Reuse </li>
<li class="fragment">Standards procedures (OpenChain)</li>
<li class="fragment">Scanning</li>
</ul>

+++

## SPDX

Software Package Data Exchange

* An open *standard* to communicate data about components, their licensing conditions and more
* <https://spdx.org/>

+++

## Reuse

* Tools and processes to make sure you offer simple and complete licensing information
* <https://reuse.software/>


+++

## Standards

**OpenChain**, a full legal compliance standard to show you have set up processes, training, documentation, to ensure compliance in your own organization and to demonstrate it.

Find more at <https://www.openchainproject.org/>

+++

## Scanning

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Only for more complex projects, with many packages</li>
<li class="fragment">Two goals:</li>
  <ul class="fragment">
  <li> "find cheaters"</li>
  <li> find accurate licensing information in the text and record them</li>
  </ul>
<li class="fragment">Most popular: <strong>Fossology</strong> (open source project)</li>
<li class="fragment">Needs to be included in CD/CI:</li>
<li class="fragment">CD/CI/<strong class="fragment">CC</strong></li>
<li class="fragment">DepTree</li>
</ul>
